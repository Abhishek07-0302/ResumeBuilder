Hacktoberfest is back this year! 

Hacktoberfest is an annual month-long celebration of open source organised every year by DIgital Ocean. Every participant who follows their set of rules and get 4 Pull Requests (PRs) merged will receive swags. For the past years, learners have been hacking throughout October in the open-source community, and this 8th year you can avail yourself the opportunity to partake and contribute to this ever-growing platform.

### Note:
Every Pull Request goes through a "Maturing Period" of two weeks, so do be patient during that duration and to make the most of your time, AVOID SPAMMY PRs!!
